To evaluate word embeddings, the following project was used:
https://github.com/kudkudak/word-embeddings-benchmarks

A copy of each word embedding file was placed in the web_data folder created upon setup.
**The first line of glove_vectors.txt that details the vocab and vector size was removed from the copy placed in web_data**

Specifically, the following commands were run in the cloned repository to evaluate each embedding:
python setup.py install
python ./scripts/evaluate_on_all.py -f w2v_vectors_copy -o w2v_output -p word2vec
python ./scripts/evaluate_on_all.py -f glove_vectors_copy.txt -o glove_output -p glove
python ./scripts/evaluate_on_all.py -f fast_text_vectors_copy -o fast_text_output -p word2vec

The following package was downloaded for Outlier Detection:
http://lcl.uniroma1.it/outlier-detection/

The first line of each word vector file containing the vocabulary and vector size was removed and then placed in the
directory.
For the Outlier Detection task, the following command was run in the directory with the corresponding vector file name:

python2 scorer_outlierdetection.py 8-8-8_Dataset/ vector_file_name
