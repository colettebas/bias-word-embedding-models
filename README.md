# An Exploration of Bias in Word Embedding Models
##Colette Basiliere

This project includes all code required to complete the Exploration of Bias in Word Embeddings project. 
This project was completed in collaboration with UMass Amherst in 2020 as a senior thesis project for 
the College of Information and Computer Sciences. 
Each portion of this project was designed as an independent module and can be run with custom word embedding inputs.

The POLUSA corpus used for the training in original project can be requested at https://zenodo.org/record/3813664#.YHjLYalKj1w.
Please contact cbasiliere@umass.edu for access to the word embedding files used to gather published results.
